    Now that we have identified our properties, we can apply several different valuation methods to arrive at an appraised value. For this exercise, we're going to assume that we have no knowledge of the specific economics of each of these properties.
    However, we can assume that we have some knowledge of different market averages and apply different valuation methods from there.
    
    We will derive our values using the following methods: \n - Replacement Cost \n - Gross Rent Multiplier \n - Capitalization Rate \n - Sales Comparison \n

st.markdown('''
    This is one of the simplest methods to apply. To apply it, we first need some data about construction costs for our area. This data will vary by location,
    the type of construction, the finishes appied, how amny stories there will be, codes for that particular area, material cost, etc. Since this isn't a demonstration
    of how to arrive at those costs, we'll wave a magic wand at our data and assume that the replacement cost for our area is $278/ft.
            ''')

st.markdown('''
    With this knowledge in hand, we can now calculate the replacement cost for the Link Apartments Mint St. We know through public records that the total finished
    area is 242,843 square feet.
    
    Multiplying this by our replacement cost, we get: 242,843 * \$278 = \$67,510,354

st.header('Gross Rent Multiplier')

        This next method relies relies on the idea that there is some relationship between the cashflow of a property and its value. The GRM (Gross Rent Multiplier)
        is about as simple as it gets. It's simply a ratio of a property's value to it's total rental income. Like all valuation methods, data is king here, and relies on
        us having a good set of data about rental incomes and property values for surrounding assets. For our purposes, we'll go ahead and assume that we have this data
        for our surrounding properties and found that the average GRM is 9.6.
''')

st.markdown('''
    The next step in our calculation is to figure out the rental income for the Link Apartments. Since we know that the average T12 rental income across ALL units is \$1,718/month,
    we can multiply this by the total number of units and then by 12 to get the annual rental income. This gives us: \$2,535 * 259 * 12 = \$7,878,780.

st.markdown('''
    Before we get to our value, when was the last time you've ever seen a building at 100\% occupancy? We need to account for this. Let's be conservative and assume that
    our occupancy should average 90\%. This gives us: \$5,339,544 * 0.9 = \$7,090,902.

    Finally, we mulitply this by our GRM to get our value: \$7,090,902 * 9.6 = \$68,072,659.

st.header('Capitalization Rate')

st.markdown('''
    Next up in our tour are cap rates. This method is the sophisticated older sibling of GRM, as it takes into account the financial performance of the asset, rather than relying on rental revenue alone, which can leave out a lot of informatin about the health of the project.
            
    The cap rate is the ratio of the net operating income (NOI) to the value of the property. The NOI is the income left over after all operating expenses have been paid. For our purposes, we'll assume that we have this data for our surrounding properties and found that the average cap rate is 6%, and we have an expense ratio 40%.
            
    We can start with the revenue value we derived in our example above, of \$7,090,902. We can then calculate the NOI by multiplying this by 1 - the expense ratio, which gives us: \$7,090,902 * 0.6 = \$4,254,541.
            
    Our final step is to divide this by our cap rate to get our value: \$4,254,541 / 0.06 = \$70,909,020.

st.header('Sales Comparison')

st.markdown('''
    The last method we'll use is the sales comparison method. Also referred to as comps, this method is based on the idea that similar properties with similar physical characteristics in similar locations should all price around the same ***relative*** valuation.
            
    While there's several ways to approach this idea, a common relative measure is price per square foot. We'll use the data we collected from our neighborhood and radius properties to calculate this value. You can view the source code to see how we're going to accmplish this.
            
    This example uses a pretty simple methodology, but more sophisticated weighting can be applied to give more recent sales a larger bias.
